# Landscape of programming

This repo aim to show you what to learn on the way to excellence. And the knowledge hierarchy is helpful for writing your resume. It's a baby yet, any improvements will be appreciated!

[	中文](zh_CN.md) [English](README.md)

In college, the scheduled classes shaped your way of learning, But after graduated, nobody telling you what to learn. You learned a lot, but in the meantime, you realized you know nothing. Because you don't have a knowledge hierarchy in your mind. This repo will(but not yet) show you a full clear view of programming techniques. Schedule your study plan with this hierarchy. Get charged before you out of battery :)

### Knowledge hierarchy for programming

_Please PR for improving the hierarchy_

##### Computer architecture

##### Programming languages

[`c/c++`](http://www.google.com) `node` `golang` `java, groovy, scala` `shell` ` type systems` `paradigms` `tool chains` `haskell` `rust`etc.

##### Data structure and algorithms

queue, set, linked list, heap, stack, hash-table, trie, b tree, b+ tree, red-black tree, splay tree, R tree etc.

dfs, bfs, quick sort, heap sort, binary search, dynamic programming, dijkstra, floyd, etc.

##### Software engineering

runtime(os, virtualization, interpreters, container..), design patterns, models(concurrency, memory, lock, epoll, nio, kqueue..), mechanisms(gc, transactional..), theories(CAP, etc), RFCs, etc

##### Software frameworks

spring-boot, boost, express, vue, protobuf, ionic, gtk, openGL, qt, etc.

##### Database and storages

relational(mysql..), document(mongodb..), time-serials(timescale..), key-value(redis..), graph(neo4j..), wild-column(cassandra..), event(event-store..), object-oriented(perst, ObjectDB..), fs, hard-disk, etc.

##### Middlewares

message-queue(rabbitmq, rocketmq, kafka..), etc.

##### Networks

tcp/ip, https, http2.0, sdn, bluetooth, routers, switchs, vlan, vxlan, firewalls, etc.

##### Software architecture and solutions

c/s, b/s, p2p, distributed systems, decentralized systems, plugin, HA, micro services, serverless, faas, cloud infrastructure, etc.

##### Software development and quality assurance

methodologies, debugging, deployment, tools, testing, mainteance, performance, docs, CI/CD, security, monitoring, etc.

##### Uncategorized



### Domain specific knowledge Sheet

##### Example

If you want to be an expert in blockchain, organize the knowledge pieces like following sheet.

### Contribution guidelines

* There are many technique items in each level, each item should have appropriate intro/def resource link. ex. [`C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language) . Modify the link if you have better one.
